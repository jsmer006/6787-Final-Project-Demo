# 6787-Final-Project-Demo


#OVERVIEW
#This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in battlefield and defense scenarios.
#The demo details a machine learning model that will be trained to detect airplanes in sattelite imagery.
#This can be very useful for defense and IoBT applications.

#INSTRUCTIONS
#Due to the large size of the training data set, we were not able to include the training sets in the repository.
#However, to train this model, download any training set from online, and get started. Simply replace the dataset you download in line 34 of the code, and you are good to go.


#RUNNING THE PROGRAM
# 1. This project is written in python, so be sure to install the latest version of Python3 to your computer.

# 2. Clone this repository to download the code.

# 3. To run the program, ensure you install all the right libraries, including tensorflow and numpy.

# 4. Then type in the terminal 'python3 Final_Project.py' to run the program.

# Note: The program will take a few minutes to run all of the epochs and generate a reliable model.

#Enjoy!
