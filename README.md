# 6787-Final-Project-Demo


#OVERVIEW
#This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in battlefield and defense scenarios.
#The demo details a machine learning model that will be trained to detect airplanes in sattelite imagery.
#This can be very useful for defense and IoBT applications.

#INSTRUCTIONS
#Due to the large size of the training data set, we were not able to include the training sets in the repository.
#However, to train this model, download any training set from online, and get started. Simply replace the dataset you download in line 34 of the code, and you are good to go.


#RUNNING THE PROGRAM
#To run the program, ensure you install all the right libraries, including tensorflow and numpy.
#Then simply run the model.

#Enjoy!
